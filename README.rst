OpenStack Operations
====================


Perform various common OpenStack operations by calling this role with an action and appropriate variables.

Restart Services
----------------

Restarting OpenStack services is complex. This role aims to intelligently evaluate the environment and determine how a service is running, what components constitute that service, and restart those components appropriately. This allows the operator to think in terms of the service that needs restarting rather than having to remember all the details required to restart that service.

This role uses a service map located in `vars/main.yml`. The service map is a dictionary with one key per service name. Each service name key contains three additional keys that list the SystemD unit files, container names, and vhosts used by each service. It is possible to extend this list of services by defining custom services in `operations_custom_service_map`. This will be combined with the default service map and passed to the `service_map_facts` module.

The `service_map_facts` module will evalute the target system and return a list of services or containers that need to be restarted. Those lists will then be used in subsequent tasks to restart a service or a container.

Fetch Logs
----------

To fetch logs with this role, use the `fetch_logs.yml` tasks file. By default, every log file in `/var/log` matching the `*.log` pattern will be fetched from the remote and put into a folder adjacent to the playbook named for each host, preserving the directory structure as found on the remote host.

See `defaults/main.yml` for the dictionary of options to control logs that are fetched.

Cleanup Container Items
-----------------------

**WARNING:** This will delete images, containers, and volumes from the target system(s).

To perform the most common cleanup tasks --- delete dangling images and volumes and delete exited or dead containers --- use the `container_cleanup.yml` tasks file.

This role includes modules for listing image, volume, and container IDs. The filtered lists (one each for images, containers, and volumes) returned by this module are used to determine which items to remove. Specifying multiple filters creates an `and` match, so all filters must match.

If using Docker, see these guides for [images](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/images/#filtering), [containers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/#filtering), and [volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_ls/#filtering) for filter options.
